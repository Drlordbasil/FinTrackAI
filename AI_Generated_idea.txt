I have a Python project idea that meets all of your requirements. How about creating an autonomous AI-powered personal expense tracker? This program will assist working-class individuals like Alex in managing their finances more effectively, optimizing their expenses, and generating passive income. Here's how it could work:

1. Intelligent Expense Tracking: The program will automatically aggregate Alex's financial transactions from their bank accounts, credit cards, and digital payment platforms. It will leverage AI algorithms to categorize and organize the expenses, providing a clear overview of their spending habits.

2. Savings Optimization: Using machine learning algorithms, the script will analyze Alex's expenses and identify potential opportunities for savings. It can detect recurring subscriptions that are no longer needed, high-cost items that can be purchased at a lower price elsewhere, and recommend ways to reduce expenses without compromising their lifestyle.

3. Budget Creation and Monitoring: Based on Alex's income and financial goals, the program will create a customized budget, allocating funds to different expense categories. It will constantly monitor their spending against this budget and provide real-time notifications and recommendations to stay on track.

4. Smart Financial Reminders: The program will leverage NLP-based models to generate personalized reminders for bill payments, subscription renewals, and other financial obligations. It will ensure that Alex avoids late fees and penalties, helping them maintain a healthy credit score.

5. Passive Income Opportunities: The script will continuously scan legitimate sources for passive income opportunities, such as cashback offers, referral programs, and online surveys. It will provide Alex with a curated list of these opportunities, allowing them to earn additional income without significant effort.

6. Smart Financial Insights: Through advanced data analytics, the program will provide Alex with detailed reports and visualizations of their financial patterns. It will highlight trends, identify potential areas of improvement, and offer actionable insights to make informed financial decisions.

This autonomous expense tracker will operate without relying on web scraping or local files. It will securely fetch financial data from legitimate sources using APIs, ensuring data privacy and security. The program will use HuggingFace small models for NLP tasks and machine learning algorithms for intelligent expense analysis and budget optimization.

By creating this autonomous AI-powered personal expense tracker, Alex and other working-class individuals can take control of their finances, save time, reduce expenses, and generate passive income without requiring any manual intervention or web scraping.
