import subprocess
Sure! Here's a chatbot script that helps the user run the provided `main.py` program locally on their PC:

```python


def run_program():
    try:
        subprocess.run(["python", "main.py"], check=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        print("An error occurred while running the program.")


def chatbot():
    print("Welcome to the Expense Tracker Chatbot!")
    print("How can I assist you today?")

    while True:
        user_input = input("> ")

        if user_input.lower() == "run program":
            print("Running the program...")
            run_program()
            print("Program execution completed.")
        elif user_input.lower() == "exit":
            print("Thank you for using the chatbot. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Sorry, I didn't understand that. Please try again.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot()
```

To use the chatbot, simply run the script and interact with the chatbot. When prompted, type "run program" to execute the `main.py` program, or type "exit" to exit the chatbot.

Note: Make sure the `main.py` file is in the same directory as the chatbot script before running.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
